This is my 2nd homework from data structures.

Desired program is explained in homework2.pdf file.

The aim is building a circular multi-linked list.

You should compile and run your implementation on Linux environment using g++ (version
4.8.5 or later). For this purpose.
Compile and link source files using the following commands. Finally, run executable file as below;
//Compiling-only
g++ -c -Wall -Werror task management tool.cpp -o task management tool.o
g++ -c -Wall -Werror app.cpp -o app.o
//Linking
g++ task management tool.o app.o -o app
//Running
./app

test.yaml file is to test program. It gives a score to the program.
